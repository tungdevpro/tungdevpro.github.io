I'm a mobile developer, currently using Flutter & SwiftUI to develop apps. I used to go to university, but at that time, I wasnâ€™t mature enough, so... ðŸ˜”. It's okay, i still got up and now i'm studying at Hanoi Open University.

My experience in the industry is still quite limited, but I believe in making small efforts that add up over time.

There is a proverb that I really like and always keep in mind: "Better to master one trade than dabble in nine."

Regarding my work philosophy, I used to write messy code, but after a few years of working, I realized that code quality and user experience are the top priorities.

My goal is to keep improving my skills while contributing to the open-source community by sharing knowledge and experience. I hope that my articles and plugins will be helpful to other developers in their product development journey.
